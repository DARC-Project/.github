# Dexterous Assistive Robots for Improved Human HealthCare

The **DARC** (Dexterous Assistive Robots for Improved Human HealthCare) project will tackle the problem of food delivery through mobile robots endowed with tactile-based manipulation skills. 
Robotic platforms that transport trays in an indoor environment are commercially available solutions. 
However, the tray setting and its delivery to the patient are still carried out by professionals who, instead of this tedious task, may direct their effort toward the actual patient care, instead. 
The main aim of this project is to develop and integrate novel paradigms, algorithms, and tools to enable autonomous, safe and robust mobile robots to manipulate and transport food in clinics and hospitals. 
We envision mobile robots able to operate close to humans and perform complex manipulation tasks, i.e., assembling, transporting, and serving meals on a tray to a patient in bed. 
The realistic achievement of this vision requires answering various research questions on how force/tactile and vision sensors can enable robust whole-body control for bimanual manipulation 
in both a prehensile and non-prehensile way. 
The related challenges can be achieved by pursuing specific research objectives about using multimodal sensing for advanced grasping and manipulation and whole-body control of a mobile manipulator 
able to furnish and deliver a food tray in a hospital ward. The expected technological output is a robot platform for food delivery in hospital wards. 
The expected impact concerns improving the quality of the healthcare staffâ€™s working conditions; consequently, the outcomes will be measurable in terms of patient care.
